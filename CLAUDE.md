# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a monorepo for Oasiz Game Studio containing 30+ browser-based games. Games are built with TypeScript and Vite, bundled into single HTML files, and deployed to the Oasiz mobile platform.

**Quality bar**: Games must be App Store quality - polished, fun, professional visuals, and satisfying "game feel."

## Development Commands

All commands run from within a game folder (e.g., `cd paddle-bounce`):

```bash
bun install      # Install dependencies
bun run dev      # Start dev server with hot reload
bun run build    # Build to dist/index.html (single-file bundle)
bun run typecheck
bun run format   # Prettier
```

Upload from repo root:

```bash
bun run upload <game-folder>              # Build + upload
bun run upload <game-folder> --skip-build # Use existing dist/
bun run upload <game-folder> --dry-run    # Test without uploading
```

## Architecture

### Project Structure

```
game-name/
├── src/
│   ├── main.ts      # Entry point for the game logic
│   └── ...          # Other TypeScript modules
├── index.html        # Entry point + ALL CSS in <style> tags
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── vite.config.js
├── publish.json      # Optional: title, description, category
├── thumbnail/        # Optional: game thumbnail
└── dist/index.html   # Build output (single file with everything inlined)
```

### Key Rules

- All game code resides in the `src/` directory. `src/main.ts` is the entry point, but code can be split across multiple files within `src/`.
- All CSS in `<style>` tags in `index.html` - no separate CSS files
- Build output is a single `dist/index.html` with all assets inlined
- No JavaScript in `index.html`

### Tech Stack

- **Bun** - Package manager and runtime
- **Vite + vite-plugin-singlefile** - Bundles everything into one HTML file
- **TypeScript** - All game logic
- **Optional**: Phaser 3, Matter.js, Tone.js, PlayroomKit (multiplayer)

## Platform Integration (CRITICAL)

### Score Submission

Call ONLY on game over with a non-negative integer:

```typescript
if (typeof (window as any).submitScore === "function") {
  (window as any).submitScore(this.score);
}
```

**Never** track high scores locally - the platform handles leaderboards.

### Haptic Feedback

```typescript
if (typeof (window as any).triggerHaptic === "function") {
  (window as any).triggerHaptic("medium"); // light, medium, heavy, success, error
}
```

| Type | Use Case |
| ------ | ---------- |
| `light` | UI taps, button presses |
| `medium` | Collecting items, standard hits |
| `heavy` | Explosions, major collisions |
| `success` | Level complete, achievements |
| `error` | Damage, game over |

### Settings Modal (MANDATORY)

Every game MUST have a settings button (gear icon) with three toggles:

1. **Music** - Background music on/off
2. **FX** - Sound effects on/off
3. **Haptics** - Vibration on/off

Save to `localStorage`, load on init. Settings button placement:

- Desktop: minimum 45px from top
- Mobile: minimum 120px from top (platform overlay)

### Responsive Design

```typescript
const isMobile = window.matchMedia('(pointer: coarse)').matches;
```

- Fill 100% viewport (`window.innerWidth` × `window.innerHeight`)
- Handle resize events
- Hide mobile controls on desktop
- Mobile touch buttons: minimum 80px, 120px+ from bottom

### Multiplayer (PlayroomKit)

Reference `draw-the-thing/` for patterns. Broadcast room code to platform:
```typescript
if (typeof (window as any).shareRoomCode === "function") {
  (window as any).shareRoomCode(getRoomCode()); // or null when leaving
}
```

## Common Pitfalls

**Avoid:**

- `Math.random()` in render loops (causes flickering) - pre-calculate during object creation
- Emojis (inconsistent across platforms) - use icon libraries
- JavaScript in `index.html`
- Tracking high scores locally
- Forgetting window resize handling

**Do:**

- Test on mobile AND desktop
- Call `window.submitScore()` on game over
- Implement haptic feedback for all interactions
- Pre-calculate random values and store as object properties

## Reference Implementations

- **Multiplayer**: `draw-the-thing/`
- **Physics**: `car-balance/` (Matter.js)
- **Audio**: `paddle-bounce/` (Tone.js)
- **Phaser 3**: `endless-hexagon/`

## Multiplayer/Networking

When building multiplayer/networking features, always reference official SDK documentation (PlayroomKit JS SDK) before implementing matchmaking, WebSocket connections, or real-time sync logic.

## Code Style

For TypeScript projects, ensure all type definitions are complete and strict - this is the primary language in use.

## Testing

- After implementing game features, provide a simple test checklist the user can run to verify core functionality works (e.g., 'Test: 1. Open two browser tabs 2. Both should connect to matchmaking 3. Game should start when matched').
- Do not run the `bun run dev` command on your own after completion since that requires user validation
- `bun run build` command returns empty response when it succeeds so do not wait extensively once it returns
